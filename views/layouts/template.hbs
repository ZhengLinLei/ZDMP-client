    ZDMP Project:

    The ZDMP project is a European project created by a consortium of 40 entities, 
    whose main objective is to provide a reference digital platform for the achievement 
    of the "zero defects" objective, with which it is intended to support quality 
    improvement both both in processes and in products.

    Manufacturing high-quality products at low cost is the best way for Europe to 
    maintain leadership in the manufacturing industry and remain competitive in a global 
    marketplace. This industry is in the midst of a digital transformation process, due 
    to the proliferation and increase of new technological solutions, which are 
    incorporated into the production chain to make it more efficient (Smart Factories 
    and industry 4.0).
    
    This is a project that aims to provide a reference digital platform for the
